# Viewing your todos
- When the website first loads, all your to-dos will be shown at the main panel on the right.
- Use the left sidebar to search your todos and/or filter by uncompleted/completed state, due date range and tags.
- NOTE: search and filter operate together, that is, it searches among the filtered to-dos, and filters on the to-dos matching the search term
